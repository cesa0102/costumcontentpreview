Some ways to support me
=======================

Steam Items
-----------

Because I am addicted to tf2 and trading inside the steam universe, I always need new items. Unusual hats, trading cards and CS:GO skins are welcome. Create a trade offer by following `a link`_.

Donate or flattr
----------------

Go back to the extension main page (https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/costumcontentpreview) an choose between the paypal "Sponsor development" or flattr button.

Money
-----

You are too rich? You want to get rid of their money? Well, we certainly find a way of which we both benefit! Look for a way to reach me here :ref:`help`.

At least support typo3
======================

If you do not like to support me or the extension (which is also me), that is fine. But then please think about to support typo3. As you use my extension, you also use typo3. One of us should get recognition! :D
